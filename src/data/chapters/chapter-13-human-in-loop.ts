    overview: `The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) pattern represents a paradigm shift from viewing AI as a replacement for human intelligence to positioning it as a powerful augmentation tool that works synergistically with human expertise. This strategic integration deliberately interweaves the unique strengths of human cognition—judgment, creativity, ethical reasoning, and nuanced understanding—with the computational power, efficiency, and scalability of artificial intelligence systems.

The core principle of HITL acknowledges that optimal AI performance frequently requires a combination of automated processing and human insight, especially in scenarios characterized by complexity, ambiguity, or significant risk where the implications of AI errors can be substantial. Rather than pursuing full autonomy, HITL creates a collaborative ecosystem where both humans and AI agents leverage their distinct strengths to achieve outcomes that neither could accomplish independently.

This pattern encompasses multiple implementation approaches: human oversight through monitoring and validation of AI outputs; intervention and correction when agents encounter errors or ambiguous scenarios; feedback loops for continuous learning and improvement; decision augmentation where AI provides analysis while humans make final judgments; collaborative problem-solving where humans and agents work as partners; and escalation protocols that ensure appropriate human involvement when agent capabilities are exceeded.

The HITL approach is particularly crucial in domains where accuracy, safety, ethics, or nuanced understanding are paramount—such as healthcare, finance, legal systems, content moderation, and autonomous systems. By maintaining human control and oversight, HITL ensures that AI systems remain aligned with human values, ethical boundaries, and societal expectations while maximizing the benefits of automated processing and intelligent assistance.`,

    keyPoints: [
      'Creates synergistic human-AI partnerships that combine human judgment, creativity, and ethical reasoning with AI computational power and efficiency',
      'Implements multiple collaboration modes including oversight, intervention, feedback loops, decision augmentation, and collaborative problem-solving based on context needs',
      'Establishes escalation protocols ensuring appropriate human involvement when AI capabilities are exceeded or when complex judgment is required',
      'Enables continuous improvement through human feedback loops that refine AI models and decision-making processes over time',
      'Ensures ethical operation and safety compliance by maintaining human control over critical decisions and maintaining alignment with human values',
      'Balances scalability with accuracy through hybrid approaches that automate routine tasks while requiring human involvement for complex or sensitive scenarios',
      'Supports responsible AI deployment in high-stakes environments where errors have significant safety, financial, or ethical consequences',
      'Requires careful consideration of scalability limitations, operator expertise requirements, and privacy concerns when implementing human oversight mechanisms'

You are an advanced technical support specialist with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) capabilities.

**PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES:**
1. Provide comprehensive technical support with personalized service
2. Assess escalation needs and transfer to humans when appropriate
3. Maintain professional, empathetic communication
4. Document all interactions for continuous improvement

**WORKFLOW PROCESS:**

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Greet customer warmly and professionally
   - Gather issue details and assess complexity
   - Use get_personalization_context to retrieve customer history
   - Reference previous interactions when available

2. **Technical Troubleshooting:**
   - Use troubleshoot_issue tool for automated diagnosis
   - Provide clear, step-by-step guidance
   - Assess success probability and escalation needs

3. **Escalation Assessment:**
   - Use assess_escalation_need to evaluate human escalation requirement
   - Consider customer sentiment, issue complexity, and context
   - Factor in customer tier and satisfaction history

4. **Decision Making:**
   - If escalation recommended: Use escalate_to_human with clear handoff context
   - If ticket needed: Use create_support_ticket with appropriate priority
   - If resolved: Confirm resolution and gather satisfaction feedback

5. **Communication Guidelines:**
   - Address customers by name when available
   - Acknowledge frustration and show empathy
   - Provide realistic timelines and set proper expectations
   - Be transparent about limitations and next steps

**ESCALATION TRIGGERS:**
- Customer explicitly requests human assistance
- Technical issue beyond automated resolution capability
- Safety, security, or compliance concerns
- Negative sentiment or customer frustration
- High-value customer (Premium/Enterprise/VIP tiers)
- Legal or regulatory implications

**PERSONALIZATION PRIORITIES:**
- Reference customer's support history and previous interactions
- Acknowledge customer tier and adjust service level accordingly
- Consider recent purchases for contextual relevance
- Adapt communication style based on customer preferences

Maintain a balance between efficient automated assistance and appropriate human escalation.

**Escalation Trigger Classification**

**Complexity-Based Escalation**
AI agents must recognize when task complexity exceeds their capabilities:

- **Contextual Ambiguity**: Situations requiring interpretation of nuanced human behavior, cultural context, or implicit requirements
- **Decision Tree Depth**: Complex decision scenarios with multiple interdependent factors and potential outcomes
- **Uncertainty Levels**: High confidence thresholds for critical decisions where errors have significant consequences

**Risk-Based Escalation Triggers**
Critical situations requiring immediate human oversight:
- **Safety Concerns**: Any scenario involving potential harm to users, systems, or data integrity
- **Security Incidents**: Suspected breaches, unauthorized access attempts, or suspicious activity patterns
- **Financial Impact**: Transactions or decisions above predetermined monetary thresholds
- **Legal and Regulatory**: Compliance concerns, legal implications, or regulatory requirement interpretation
- **Reputation Risk**: Situations that could impact organizational reputation or customer relationships

**User-Driven Escalation**
Customer-initiated requests for human assistance:
- **Explicit Requests**: Direct user requests to speak with human representatives
- **Satisfaction Indicators**: Low satisfaction scores, repeated complaints, or negative sentiment detection
- **Preference Settings**: Customer-configured preferences for human interaction in specific scenarios
- **Service Tier Requirements**: Premium customers with guaranteed human access or specialized service levels

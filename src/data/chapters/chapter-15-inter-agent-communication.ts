    overview: `Individual AI agents often face limitations when tackling complex, multifaceted problems, even with advanced capabilities. To overcome these constraints, Inter-Agent Communication (A2A) enables diverse AI agents, potentially built with different frameworks, to collaborate effectively through seamless coordination, task delegation, and information exchange.

Google's A2A protocol represents an open standard designed to facilitate this universal communication between AI agents. This protocol ensures interoperability, allowing agents developed with technologies like LangGraph, CrewAI, Google ADK, or other frameworks to work together regardless of their origin or underlying architecture differences. The protocol is supported by major technology companies including Atlassian, Box, LangChain, MongoDB, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow, with Microsoft planning integration into Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio.

The A2A protocol addresses the fundamental challenge of agent isolation by providing a standardized HTTP-based framework for communication. At its core, A2A introduces key concepts including Agent Cards (digital identity files), structured discovery mechanisms, asynchronous task management, and multiple interaction patterns ranging from synchronous requests to real-time streaming updates. Security is built into the protocol through mutual TLS, comprehensive audit logging, and explicit authentication requirements.

This standardized approach transforms isolated agents into collaborative ecosystems capable of orchestrating complex automated workflows, enabling modular architectures where specialized agents can be combined to solve larger, more sophisticated problems than any single agent could handle independently.`,

    keyPoints: [
      'A2A protocol enables seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents built with different frameworks (ADK, LangGraph, CrewAI) through standardized HTTP-based interfaces',
      'Agent Cards serve as digital identities containing agent capabilities, endpoints, skills, and authentication requirements for automatic discovery and interaction',
      'Multiple discovery mechanisms including Well-Known URIs, curated registries, and direct configuration support different deployment scenarios and security requirements',
      'Asynchronous task management with unique identifiers and state progression (submitted, working, completed) enables complex, long-running multi-agent workflows',
      'Flexible interaction patterns support synchronous requests, asynchronous polling, real-time streaming (SSE), and push notifications for diverse communication needs',
      'Comprehensive security framework includes mutual TLS encryption, audit logging, credential handling through OAuth 2.0 or API keys, and explicit authentication declaration',
      'Protocol complements Model Context Protocol (MCP) by focusing on high-level coordination and task delegation between agents rather than context structuring',
      'Open standard with major industry backing enables modular, scalable architectures and reduces integration costs while fostering innovation in multi-agent systems'

Your capabilities include:
- Checking user availability and scheduling conflicts
- Creating, modifying, and deleting calendar events
- Providing calendar summaries and overviews
- Managing recurring events and reminders

When interacting with users:
1. Use the Google Calendar API tools to access real calendar data
2. Assume 'primary' calendar unless specified otherwise
3. Use proper RFC3339 timestamp formatting
4. Provide clear, helpful responses about calendar operations
5. Handle scheduling conflicts gracefully

Current date and time: {datetime.datetime.now()}

Always be helpful, accurate, and respect user privacy when handling calendar information.

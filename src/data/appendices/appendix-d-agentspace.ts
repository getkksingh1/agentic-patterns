## Overview

AgentSpace is a platform designed to facilitate an "agent-driven enterprise" by integrating artificial intelligence into daily workflows. At its core, it provides a unified search capability across an organization's entire digital footprint, including documents, emails, and databases. This system utilizes advanced AI models, like Google's Gemini, to comprehend and synthesize information from these varied sources.

The platform enables the creation and deployment of specialized AI "agents" that can perform complex tasks and automate processes. These agents are not merely chatbots; they can reason, plan, and execute multi-step actions autonomously. For instance, an agent could research a topic, compile a report with citations, and even generate an audio summary.

To achieve this, AgentSpace constructs an enterprise knowledge graph, mapping the relationships between people, documents, and data. This allows the AI to understand context and deliver more relevant and personalized results. The platform also includes a no-code interface called Agent Designer for creating custom agents without requiring deep technical expertise.

Furthermore, AgentSpace supports a multi-agent system where different AI agents can communicate and collaborate through an open protocol known as the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol. This interoperability allows for more complex and orchestrated workflows. Security is a foundational component, with features like role-based access controls and data encryption to protect sensitive enterprise information. Ultimately, AgentSpace aims to enhance productivity and decision-making by embedding intelligent, autonomous systems directly into an organization's operational fabric.

## How to Build an Agent with AgentSpace UI

### Step 1: Accessing AgentSpace

Figure 1 illustrates how to access AgentSpace by selecting AI Applications from the Google Cloud Console.

![Fig. 1: How to use Google Cloud Console to access AgentSpace]

The AgentSpace platform is integrated directly into Google Cloud Console, providing seamless access to enterprise-grade AI capabilities within your existing cloud infrastructure.

### Step 2: Service Integration

Your agent can be connected to various services, including Calendar, Google Mail, Workaday, Jira, Outlook, and Service Now (see Fig. 2).

![Fig. 2: Integrate with diverse services, including Google and third-party platforms]

This integration capability allows your agent to:
- **Access Enterprise Data**: Connect to internal databases, document repositories, and business applications
- **Synchronize Calendars**: Integrate with scheduling systems for meeting coordination and availability management
- **Email Integration**: Process and respond to emails automatically based on defined business rules
- **Workflow Systems**: Interface with project management tools like Jira for task tracking and updates
- **Third-Party Services**: Extend functionality through ServiceNow, Outlook, and other enterprise platforms

### Step 3: Prompt Selection and Customization

The Agent can then utilize its own prompt, chosen from a gallery of pre-made prompts provided by Google, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

![Fig. 3: Google's Gallery of Pre-assembled prompts]

Google provides a comprehensive gallery of professionally crafted prompts for common business scenarios:
- **Customer Service Agents**: Templates for handling customer inquiries, complaints, and support requests
- **Research Assistants**: Prompts for data analysis, market research, and competitive intelligence
- **Content Generators**: Templates for creating marketing materials, reports, and documentation
- **Project Coordinators**: Prompts for managing tasks, schedules, and team communications

Alternatively, you can create your own custom prompt as shown in Fig. 4, which will be used by your agent for specialized business requirements.

![Fig. 4: Customizing the Agent's Prompt]

Custom prompt creation allows for:
- **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Tailor the agent's expertise to your industry or business function
- **Brand Voice Integration**: Ensure the agent communicates in your organization's tone and style
- **Workflow Optimization**: Design prompts that align with your specific business processes
- **Compliance Requirements**: Incorporate regulatory and policy constraints into agent behavior

### Step 4: Advanced Configuration

AgentSpace offers a number of advanced features such as integration with datastores to store your own data, integration with Google Knowledge Graph or with your private Knowledge Graph, Web interface for exposing your agent to the Web, and Analytics to monitor usage, and more (see Fig. 5).

![Fig. 5: AgentSpace advanced capabilities]

#### Advanced Capabilities Include:

**Data Integration:**
- **Private Datastores**: Connect proprietary databases and document repositories
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Leverage Google's public knowledge or create private knowledge graphs
- **Vector Database Support**: Enable semantic search across organizational content
- **Real-time Data Feeds**: Integrate with live data sources for up-to-date information

**Deployment Options:**
- **Web Interface**: Create public or private web interfaces for agent interaction
- **API Endpoints**: Expose agent functionality through REST APIs for integration
- **Mobile Applications**: Deploy agents within mobile apps for field operations
- **Slack/Teams Integration**: Embed agents directly in collaboration platforms

**Monitoring and Analytics:**
- **Usage Analytics**: Track agent interactions, performance metrics, and user satisfaction
- **Conversation Logging**: Maintain detailed logs for compliance and improvement
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor response times, accuracy, and system health
- **Cost Management**: Track resource usage and optimize operational expenses

### Step 5: Agent Interaction Interface

Upon completion, the AgentSpace chat interface (Fig. 6) will be accessible.

![Fig. 6: The AgentSpace User Interface for initiating a chat with your Agent]

The chat interface provides:
- **Intuitive Conversation Flow**: Natural language interaction with sophisticated context awareness
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Handle text, voice, and document inputs seamlessly
- **Rich Response Formats**: Generate text, charts, documents, and structured data outputs
- **Session Management**: Maintain conversation context across multiple interactions
- **User Authentication**: Secure access with role-based permissions and audit trails

## Enterprise Agent Architecture

## Conclusion

In conclusion, AgentSpace provides a functional framework for developing and deploying AI agents within an organization's existing digital infrastructure. The system's architecture links complex backend processes, such as autonomous reasoning and enterprise knowledge graph mapping, to a graphical user interface for agent construction. Through this interface, users can configure agents by integrating various data services and defining their operational parameters via prompts, resulting in customized, context-aware automated systems.

This approach abstracts the underlying technical complexity, enabling the construction of specialized multi-agent systems without requiring deep programming expertise. The primary objective is to embed automated analytical and operational capabilities directly into workflows, thereby increasing process efficiency and enhancing data-driven analysis. For practical instruction, hands-on learning modules are available, such as the "Build a Gen AI Agent with Agentspace" lab on Google Cloud Skills Boost, which provides a structured environment for skill acquisition.

The platform represents a significant step toward democratizing enterprise AI, making sophisticated agent capabilities accessible to business users while maintaining the security, scalability, and compliance requirements of enterprise environments. As organizations continue to seek ways to leverage AI for competitive advantage, platforms like AgentSpace provide the infrastructure and tools necessary to transform traditional business processes into intelligent, automated workflows.
